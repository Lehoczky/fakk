This package helps you to undo your last commit or remove git hooks with ease. Don't need to google "undo last commit" ever again!

‚úÖ Use this, if you:

- already have a JavaScript runtime installed
- don't like using shell scripts
- need a cross-platform solution

‚ùå Don't use this, if you:

- like to configure global shell scripts, and aliases
- know these commands even without looking them up
- are a very responsible developer, who never commits anything unintentionally

## üíø Installation

```sh
pnpm add -g @lehoczky/fakk
```

## üíª Usage

### Undo last commit

In case you committed something you shouldn't have.

```sh
$ git commit -m "Something terribly misguided"
$ fakk
```

```sh
$ fakk hooks
```
